\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.\
\
But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only \
\
be broken by love's first kiss.\
\
She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing \
\
dragon.\
\
Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, \
\
but non prevailed.\
\
She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest \
\
tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.\
\
\{Laughing\} \
\
Like that's ever gonna happen.\
\
\{Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes\}\
\
What a load of - \
\
\
\
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me\
\
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed\
\
She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb\
\
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead\
\
The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'\
\
Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'\
\
Didn't make sense not to live for fun\
\
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb\
\
So much to do so much to see\
\
So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets\
\
You'll never know if you don't go\
\
You'll never shine if you don't glow\
\
Hey, now You're an all-star\
\
Get your game on, go play\
\
Hey, now You're a rock star\
\
Get the show on, get paid\
\
And all that glitters is gold\
\
Only shootin' stars break the mold\
\
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder\
\
You're bundled up now but wait till you get older\
\
But the meteor men beg to differ\
\
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture\
\
The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin\
\
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim\
\
My world's on fire\
\
How 'bout yours\
\
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored\
\
Hey, now, you're an all-star\
\

\
\
\
-Think it's in there?\
\
-All right. Let's get it!\
\
-Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?\
\
-Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.\
\
\{Laughs\}\
\
-Yes, well, actually, that would be a gaint.\
\
Now, ogres - - They're much worse.\
\
They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.\
\
-No!\
\
-They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!\
\
Actually, it's quite good on toast.\
\
-Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!\
\
\{Gasping\}\
\
-Right.\

\
\{Gasping\}\

\
"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."\
\
\{Sighs\}\
\
\{Man's voice\} All right. This one's full.\
\
-Take it away!\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
-Move it along. Come on! Get up!\
\
-Next!\
\
-Give me that! Your fiying days are over.\
\
That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!\
\
-Get up! Come on!\
\
-Twenty pieces.\
\
\{Thudding\}\
\
-Sit down there!\
\
-Keep quiet!\
\
\{Crying\}\
\
-This cage is too small.\
\
-Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again.\
\
I can change. Please! Give me another chance!\
\
-Oh, shut up.\
\
-Oh!\
\
-Next!\
\
-What have you got?\
\
-This little wooden puppet.\
\
-I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.\
\
-Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.\
\
-Father, please! Don't let them do this!\
\
-Help me!\
\
-Next! What have you got?\
\
-Well, I've got a talking donkey.\
\
\{Grunts\}\
\
-Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.\
\
-Oh, go ahead, little fella.\
\
-Well?\
\
-Oh, oh, he's just - - He's just a little nervous.\
\
He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt - -\
\
-That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!\
\
-No, no, he talks! He does. I can talk. I love to talk.\
\
I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.\
\
-Get her out of my sight.\
\
-No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
-Hey! I can fly!\
\
-He can fly!\
\
-He can fly!\
\
-He can talk!\
\
-Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.\
\
You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly\
\
but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha!\
\
Oh-oh.\
\
\{Grunts\}\
\
-Seize him!\
\
-After him! He's getting away!\
\
\{Grunts, Gasps\}\
\
\{Man\}\
\
-Get him! This way! Turn!\
\
-You there. Orge!\
\
-Aye?\
\
-By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under \
\
arrest\
\
and transport you to a designated..... resettlement facility.\
\
-Oh, really? You and what army?\
\
\{Gasps, Whimpering\}\
\
\{Chuckles\}\
\
-Can I say something to you?\
\
-Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. \
\
Incredible!\
\
Are you talkin' to - - me? Whoa!\
\
-Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great \
\
back here? Those guards!\
\
They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They \
\
was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made \
\
me feel good to see that.\
\
-Oh, that's great. Really.\
\
-Man, it's good to be free.\
\
-Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? \
\
Hmm?\
\
-But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by \
\
myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. \
\
You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit \
\
out of anybody that crosses us.\
\
\{Roaring\}\
\
-Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that \
\
don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you \
\
definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks!\
\
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - \
\
\{Mumbling\}\
\
Than I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my \
\
butt that day.\
\
-Why are you following me?\
\
-I'll tell you why. \
\
\
\
'Cause I'm all alone\
\
There's no one here beside me\
\
My promlems have all gone\
\
There's no one to deride me\
\
But you gotta heve friends - - \
\
\
\
-Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.\
\
-Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.\
\
-Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?\
\
-Uh - - Really tall?\
\
-No! I'm an orge! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't \
\
that bother you?\
\
-Nope.\
\
-Really?\
\
-Really, really.\
\
-Oh.\
\
-Man, I like you. What's you name?\
\
-Uh, Shrek.\
\
-Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek?\
\
You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.\
\
I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that. \
\
Who'd want to live in place like that?\
\
-That would be my home.\
\
-Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a \
\
decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I \
\
like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.\
\
-I guess you don't entertain much, do you?\
\
-I like my privacy.\
\
-You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I \
\
hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them \
\
a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence.\
\
-Can I stay with you?\
\
-Uh, what?\
\
-Can I stay with you, please?\
\
-Of course!\
\
-Really?\
\
-No.\
\
-Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to \
\
be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta \
\
stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!\
\
-Okay! Okay! But one night only.\
\
-Ah! Thank you!\
\
-What are you - - No! No!\
\
-This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, \
\
and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.\
\
-Oh!\
\
-Where do, uh, I sleep?\
\
-Outside!\
\
-Oh, well. I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you \
\
don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know.\
\
\{Sniffles\}\
\
-Here I go.\
\
-Good night.\
\
\{Sighs\}\
\
-I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. \
\
I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, \
\
outside.\
\
\
\
I'm all alone\
\
There's no one here beside me\

\
-Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we \
\
have? \
\
-It's not home, but it'll do just fune.\
\
-What a lovely bed.\
\
-Got ya.\
\
\{Sniffs\} I found some cheese.\
\
-Ow! \{Grunts\}\
\
-Blah! Awful stuff.\
\
-Is that you, Gorder?\
\
-How did you know?\
\
-Enough! What are you doing in my house?\
\
\{Grunts\}\
\
-Hey!\
\
\{Snickers\}\
\
-Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.\
\
-Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.\
\
-Huh?\
\
\{Gusps\}\
\
\{Male voice\} What?\
\
-I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying orge! What do I \
\
have to do get a little privacy?\
\
-Aah!\
\
-Oh, no. No! No!\
\
\{Cackling\}\
\
-What?\

-Quickly. Come on!\

-Oh!\

\
-Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.\
\
-Oh, gosh, no one invited us.\
\
-What?\
\
-We were forced to come here.\
\
-By who?\
\
-Lord Farquaad.\
\
-He huffed und he puffed und he...... signed an eviction notice.\
\
\{Sighs\}\
\
-All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?\
\
\{Murmuring\}\
\
-Oh, I do. I know where he is.\
\
-Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?\
\
-Me! Me!\
\
-Anyone?\
\
-Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!\
\
\{Sighs\}\
\
-Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. \
\
Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy \
\
Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came \
\
from!\
\
\{Cheering\}\
\
\{Twittering\}\
\
-Oh! You! You're comin' with me.\
\
- All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two \
\
stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!\
\
-On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek.\
\
-Hey. Oh, oh!\
\
-I can't wait to get on the road again.\
\
-What did I say about singing?\
\
-Can I whistle?\
\
-No.\
\
-Can I hum it?\
\
-All right, hum it.\

\
-You are a monster.\
\
-I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy \
\
tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the \
\
others?\
\
-Eat me!\{Grunts\}\
\
-I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached \
\
its end! Tell me or I'll - -\
\
-No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons.\
\
-All right then. Who's hiding them?\
\
-Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?\
\
-The muffin man?\
\
-The muffin man.\
\
-Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?\
\
-Well, she's married to the muffin man.\
\
-The muffin man?\
\
-The muffin man!\
\
-She's married to the muffin man.\
\

-Oh!\
\
-Magic mirror - - \
\
-Don't tell him anything!\
\
-No!\
\
\{Ginerbread man whispers\}\
\
-Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect \
\
kingdom of them all?\
\
-Well, technically you're not a king.\
\
-Uh, Thelonius.\
\
-You were saying?\
\
-What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one.  All \
\
you have to do is marry a princess.\
\
-Go on.\
\
\{Chuckles\}\
\
-So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to \
\
meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette \
\
number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. \
\
She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking \
\
and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.\
\
-Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of \
\
fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just \
\
kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come \
\
on. Give it up for Snow White!\
\
-And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a \
\
fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling \
\
lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes \
\
pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, \
\
Princess Fiona!\
\
-So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or \
\
bachelorette number three?\
\
-Two! Two!\
\
-Three! Three!\
\
-Two! Two!\
\
-Three! \
\
-Three? One?\
\
\{Shudders\} Three?\
\
--Three! Pick number three, my lord!\
\
-Okay, okay, uh, number three!\
\
-Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.\
\
\
\
If you like pina coladas\
\
And getting caught in the rain\
\
\
\
-Princess Fiona.\
\
\
\
If you're not into yoga\
\
\
\
-She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go - - \
\
-But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.\
\
-I'll do it.\
\
-Yes, but after sunset - -\
\
-Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will \
\
finally have the perfect king!\
\
Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament.\
\
\
\
-But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd \
\
find it.\
\
-So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.\
\
-Uh-huh. That's the place.\
\
-Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?\
\
\{Laughs\}\
\
\{Groans\}\
\
-Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.\
\
-Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.\
\
-Hey, you!\

\
-Sorry about that.\
\
\{Cheering\}\
\
-That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go \
\
forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the \
\
dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first \
\
runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you mae \
\
die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.\
\
\{Cheering\}\
\
-Let the tournament begin!\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
-Oh!\
\
-What is that?\
\
\{Gasping\}\
\
-It's hideous!\
\
-Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey.\
\
-Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the orge will be named \
\
champion! Have it him!\
\
-Get him!\
\
-Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now.\
\
-Go ahead! Get him!\

-Can't we just settle this over a pint?\

\
-Damn!\

\
\
A girl can do what she wants to do\
\
And that's what I'm gonna do\

And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation\
\
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me\
\
Me, me, me\

\
\
-Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!\

\
\{Shrek laughs\}\
\
\{Crowd gasping, murmuring\}\
\
-Shall I give the order, sir?\
\
-No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!\
\
-What?\
\
-Congratulations, orge. You're won the honor of embarking on a great \
\
and noble quest.\
\
-Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back.\
\
-Your swamp?\
\
-Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those tale creatures!\
\
\{Crowd murmuring\}\
\
-Indeed. All right, orge. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for \
\
me, and I'll give you your swamp back.\
\
-Exactly the way it was?\
\
-Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.\
\
-And the squatters?\
\
-As good as gone.\
\
-What kind of quest?\
\
-Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a \
\
princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only \
\
don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place.\
\
-Is that about right?\
\
-Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.\
\
-I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on \
\
him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make \
\
your bread, the whole orge trip.\
\
-Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and \
\
put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and \
\
drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?\
\
-Uh, no, not really, no.\
\
-For your information, there's a lot more to orges than people think.\
\
-Example?\
\
-Example? Okay, um, orges are like onions.\
\
-\{Sniffs\} They stink?\
\
-Yes - - No!\
\
-They make you cry?\
\
-No!\
\
-You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little \
\
white hairs.\
\
-No! Layers! Onions have layers. Orges have layers! Onions have \
\
layers. You get it? We both have layers. \
\
\{Sighs\}\
\
-Oh, you both have layers. Oh. \{Sniffs\} You know, not everybody likes \
\
onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.\
\
-I don't care... what everyone likes. Orges are not like cakes.\
\
-You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a \
\
person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "No, I don't like \
\
no parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.\
\
-No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Orges are like \
\
onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.\
\
-Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.\
\
-You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissure or \
\
something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start \
\
slobbering.\
\
\
\
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today\
\
Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh\
\
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today\
\
Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh\
\
And everything that you receive up yonder\
\
Is what you give to me the day I wander\
\
I'm on my way \
\
I'm on my way \
\
I'm on my way \
\
\
\
-Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?\
\
-You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was \
\
open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. \{Sniffs\} It's \
\
brimstone We must be getting close.\
\
-Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I \
\
know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone \
\
neither.\
\
\{Rumbling\}\
\
-Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location.\
\
\{Laughing\}\
\
-Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said orges have layers?\
\
-Oh, aye.\
\
-Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have \
\
layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.\
\
-Wait a second.  Donkeys don't have sleeves.\
\
-You know what I mean.\
\
-You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.\
\
-I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over \
\
a boiling like of lava!\
\
-Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional \
\
support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step \
\
at a time.\
\
-Really?\
\
-Really, really.\
\
-Okay, that makes me feel so much better.\
\
-Just keep moving. And don't look  down.\
\
-Okay, don't look  down. Don't look  down. Don't look  down. Keep on \
\
moving. Don't look  down.\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
-Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, \
\
please! \
\
-But you're already halfway.\
\
-But I know that half is safe!\
\
-Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.\
\
-Shrek, no! Wait!\
\
-Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me?\
\
-Don't do that!\
\
-Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?\
\
-Oh, this?\
\
-Yes, that!\
\
-Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.\
\
\{Screams\}\
\
-No, Shrek! No! Stop it!\
\
-You said do it! I'm doin' it.\
\
-I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh!\
\
-That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.\
\
-Cool.\
\
-So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?\
\
-Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.\
\
\{Chuckles\}\
\
-I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.\
\
\{Water dripping, wind howling\}\
\
-You afraid?\
\
-No.\
\
-But - -\
\
- Shh.\
\
-Oh, good. Me neither.\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
-'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible \
\
response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I \
\
might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and \
\
breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little \
\
scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
-Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if \
\
you can find any stairs.\
\
-Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.\
\
-The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest \
\
tower.\
\
-What makes you think she'll be there?\
\
-I read it in a book once.\
\
-Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those \
\
stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way \
\
they're goin'.\
\
\{Creacing\}\
\
-I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with \
\
me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a \
\
step right here. I'd step all over it.\
\
-Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - \
\
-Dragon!\
\
\{Screams\}\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
\{Roars\}\

-Donkey, look out!\

-Oh! Aah! Aah!\
\
\{Gasping\}\
\
\{Crowls\}\
\
-No. Oh, no, No!\
\
\{Screams\}\
\
-Oh, what large teeth you have.\
\
\{Crowls\}\
\
-I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time \
\
from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile \
\
you got  there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know \
\
what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of \
\
course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. \
\
What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. \
\
Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh - - \
\
(Coughs)\
\
-I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna \
\
blow smoke rings. Shrek!\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
\{Whimpering\}\
\
-No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!\
\
\{Groans, Sighs\}\
\
\{Vocalizing\}\
\
-Oh! Oh!\
\
-Wake up!\
\
-What?\
\
-Are you Princess Fiona?\
\
-I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.\
\
-Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!\
\
-But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be \
\
a wonderful, romantic moment?\
\
-Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.\
\
-Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out \
\
yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.\
\
-You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?\
\
-Mm-hmm.\
\
\{Screams, grunts\}\
\
-But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for \
\
me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!\
\
-I don't think so.\
\
-Can I at least know the name of my champion?\
\
-Um, Shrek.\
\
-Sir Shrek.\
\
\{Cleans throat\}\
\
-I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.\
\
-Thanks!\
\
\{Roaring\}\
\
-You didn't slay the dragon?\
\
-It's on my to-do list. Now come on!\
\
\{Screams\}\
\
-But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, \
\
banner flying. That's what all the other knights did.\
\
-Yeah, right before they burst into flame.\
\
-That's not the point. Oh!\
\
-Wait. Where are you going? The next's over there.\
\
-Well, I have to save my ass.\
\
-What kind of knight are you?\
\
-One of a kind.\
\
-Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to \
\
know someone over a long perriod of time. Just call me old-fashioned. \
\
\{Laughs\}\
\
-I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not \
\
emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - -  Magnitude really \
\
is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted \
\
physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back \
\
up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to \
\
know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, \
\
but I just love receiving cards - -  I'd really love to stay, but - - \
\
Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna \
\
tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with \
\
that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!\
\
\{Growls\}\
\
\{Roaring\}\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
-Hi, Princess!\
\
-It talks!\
\
-Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.\
\
\{Screams\}\
\
\{Screaming\}\
\
-Oh!\
\
\{Thuds\}\
\
\{Groans\}\
\
\{Roars\}\
\
\{Roaring\}\
\
-Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon.\
\
\{Fchoing\}\
\
-Run!\

\
\{Screaming\}\
\
\{Roaring\}\
\
\{Screams\}\
\
\{Roars\}\
\
\{Panting, sighs\}\
\
\{Whimpers\}\
\
\{Roars\}\
\
-You did it!\
\
-You rescued me! You're amazing. You're - - You're wonderful. \
\
You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But they deed is great, and \
\
thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. \
\
\{Clears throat\}\
\
-And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?\
\
-I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a \
\
steed.\
\
-The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.\
\
-Uh, no.\
\
-Why not?\
\
-I have helmet hair.\
\
-Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.\
\
-No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.\
\
-But how will you kiss me?\
\
-What? That wasn't in the job description.\
\
-Maybe it's a perk.\
\
-No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in \
\
a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then \
\
they share true love's first kiss.\
\
-Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you \
\
true love?\
\
-Well, yes.\
\
\{Laughing\}\
\
-You think Shrek is your true love!\
\
-What is so funny?\
\
-Let's just say I'm not your tipe, okay?\
\
-Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your \
\
helmet.\
\
-Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.\
\
-Just take off the helmet.\
\
-I'm not going to.\
\
-Take ot off.\
\
-No!\
\
-Now!\
\
-Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.\
\
-You- - You're a- - an orge.\
\
-Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.\
\
-Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed \
\
to be an orge.\
\
\{Sighs\}\
\
-Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the \
\
one who wants to marry you.\
\
-Then why didn't he come rescue me?\
\
-Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.\
\
-But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some prge and his- - \
\
his pet.\
\
-So much for noble steed.\
\
-You're not making my job any easier.\
\
-I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad \
\
that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right \
\
here.\
\
-Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.\
\
-You wouldn't dare. Put me down!\
\
-Ya comin', Donkey?\
\
-I'm right behind ya.\
\
-Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not \
\
dignified! Put me down!\
\
-Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, \
\
right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down \
\
real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a \
\
crisp and eaten?\
\
-You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knowest what \
\
happens when you find your - -  Hey!\
\
\{Sighs\}\
\
-The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.\
\
-You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!\
\
-And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?\
\
-Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in \
\
short supply.\
\
\{Laughs\}\
\
-I don't know. There are those who think little of him.\
\
-Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never \
\
measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.\
\
-Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the \
\
"measuring" when you see him tomorrow.\
\
-Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?\
\
-No, that'll take longer. We can keep going.\
\
-But there's robbers in the woods.\
\
-Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good.\
\
-Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this \
\
forest.\
\
-I need to find somewhere to camp now!\
\
\{Birds wings fluttering\}\
\
\{Grunting\}\
\
-Hey! Over here.\
\
-Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a \
\
princess.\
\
-No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.\
\
-Homey touches? Like what?\
\
\{Crashing\}\
\
-A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.\
\
-You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.\
\
-I said good night!\
\
-Shrek, What are you doing?\
\
\{Laughs\}\
\
-I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.\
\
\{Fire cracking\}\
\
-And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only orge to ever spit over \
\
three wheat fields. Right. Yeah.\
\
-Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?\
\
-The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, \
\
there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.\
\
-I know you're making this up.\
\
-No, look. There he is,  and there's the group of hunters running away \
\
from his stench.\
\
-That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.\
\
-You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? \
\
Forget it.\
\
\{Sighs\}\
\
-Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?\
\
-Our swamp?\
\
-You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.\
\
-We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's no "our". There's just me and my \
\
swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my \
\
land.\
\
-You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what \
\
I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody \
\
out.\
\
-No, do ya think?\
\
-Are you hidin' something?\
\
-Never mind, Donkey.\
\
-Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?\
\
-No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things.\
\
-Why don't you want to talk about it?\
\
-Why do you want to talk about it?\
\
-Why are you blocking?\
\
-I'm not blocking.\
\
-Oh, yes, you are.\
\
-Donkey, I'm warning you.\
\
-Who you trying to keep out?\
\
-Everyone! Okay?\
\
-Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.\
\
-Oh! For the love of Pete!\
\
-What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?\
\
-Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that \
\
seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. \
\
"Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly orge!" They judge me before they \
\
even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.\
\
-You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, \
\
stupid, ugly orge.\
\
-Yeah, I know.\
\
-So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?\
\
-Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying.\
\
-Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one \
\
there?\
\
-That's the moon.\
\
-Oh, okay.\

\
-Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs?\
\
-Good morning, Princess!\
\
-What's all this about?\

-You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to \
\
make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.\

\
-Thanks.\
\
-She's as nasty as you are.\

you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the \

find me a blue flower with red thorns.\

Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!\

-Aah!\
\
\
\
She will always be the only thing\
\
That comes between me and the awful sting\
\
That comes from living in a world\
\
that's so damn mean\
\
\{Croaks\}\
\
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh\
\
-Hey!\
\
La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la\
\
\{Both laughing\}\
\
La-la, la-la, la-la\
\
\
\
-There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you.\
\
-That's DuLoc?\
\
-Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for \
\
something,  which I think means he has a really - - Ow!\
\
-Um, I, uh- -  I guess we better move on.\
\
-Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried about Donkey.\
\
\{Blubbering\}\
\
-What?\
\
-I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good. \
\
-What are you talking about? I'm fine.\
\
-That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on \
\
your back. Dead.\
\
-You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?\
\
-Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.\
\
-I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and \
\
when I turn my head like this, look, \
\
\{Bones crunch\}\
\
-Ow! See?\
\
-Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.\
\
-I'll get the firewood.\
\
-Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! I don't have any \
\
toes! I think I need a hug.\
\
\
\
-Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?\
\
-Uh, weedrat. Rotisserie style.\
\
-No kidding. Well, this is delicious.\
\
-Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I \
\
make a mean weedrat stew.\
\
\{Chuckling\}\
\
\{Sighs\}\
\
-I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.\
\
\{Gulps\}\
\
-Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind \
\
of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it.\
\
\{Chuckles\}\
\
-I'd like that.\
\
\{Slurps, laughs\}\
\
\
\
See the pyramids along the Nile\
\
\
\
-Um, Princess?\
\
\
\
Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle\
\
\
\
-Yes, Shrek?\
\
-I, um, I was wondering.\
\
\
\
Just remember, darling all the while\
\
\
\
-Are you- - \
\
\
\
You belong to me\
\
\
\
\{Sighs\} \
\
-Are you gonna eat that?\
\
\{Chuckles\}\
\
-Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.\
\
-Sunset?\
\
-Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late.\
\
-What?\
\
-Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, \
\
aren't you?\
\
-Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside.\
\
-Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until \
\
- - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.\
\
\{Shrek sighs\}\
\
 -Good night.\
\
 -Good night.\
\
\{Door creaks\}\
\
-Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.\
\
-Oh, what are you talkin' about?\
\
-I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. \
\
And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.\
\
-You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.\
\
-Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in \
\
and tell her how you feel.\
\
-I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, \
\
well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a \
\
princess, and I'm - - \
\
-An orge?\
\
-Yeah. An orge.\
\
-Hey, where you goin'?\
\
-To get... move firewood.\
\
\{Sighs\} \
\
\
\
-Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you?\
\
\{Wings fluttering\}\
\
-Princess?\
\
\{Creaking\}\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
-It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.\
\
\{Screams\}\
\
-Aah!\
\
-Oh, no!\
\
-No, help!\
\
-Shh!\
\
-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!\
\
-No, it's okay. It's okay.\
\
-What did you do with the princess?\
\
-Donkey, I'm the princess.\
\
-Aah!\
\
-It's me, in this body.\
\
-Oh, my God! You ate the princess. Can you hear me?\
\
-Donkey!\
\
-Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!\
\
-No!\
\
-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!\
\
-Shh.\
\
-Shrek!\
\
-This is me.\
\
\{Muffled mumbling\}\
\
-Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.\
\
-I'm ugly, okay?\
\
-Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats \
\
was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - - \
\
-No.\
\
-I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember.\
\
-What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.\
\
-It's only happens when sun goes down.\
\
"By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you \
\
find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."\
\
-Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.\
\
-It's a spell.\
\
\{Sighs\} \
\
-When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I \
\
become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to \
\
await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry \
\
Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.\
\
\{Sobs\}\
\
-All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not \
\
that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look \
\
like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.\
\
-But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant \
\
to look.\
\
-Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?\
\
-I have to.  Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.\
\
-But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you \
\
got a lot in common.\
\
-Shrek?\
\
\
\
-Princess, I - - Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for \
\
me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's \
\
pretty and - - well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might \
\
like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd - - uh, uh - \
\
- \
\
\{Sighs\}\
\
-I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.\
\
-I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I \
\
mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? \
\
"Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here \
\
with Shrek.\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
-My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.\
\
\{Deep sigh\}\
\
-Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only \
\
way to break the spell.\
\
-You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.\
\
-No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.\
\
-What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?\
\
-Promise you won't tell. Promise!\
\
-All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. I just know \
\
before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy.\
\
-Look at my eye twitchin'.\
\
\{Door opens\}\
\
\{Snoring\}\
\
-I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. \
\
-Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want - - \
\
\{Snoring\}\
\
-Shrek. Are you all right?\
\
-Perfect! Never been better.\
\
-I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you.\
\
-You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last \
\
night.\
\
-You heard what I said?\
\
-Every word.\
\
-I thought you'd understand.\
\
-Oh, I undersatnd. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly \
\
beast?" \
\
-But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.\
\
-Yeah? Well, it does.\
\
\{Gasps, sighs\}\
\
-Ah, right on time.\
\
\{Horse whinnies\}\
\
-Princess, I've brought you a little something.\
\
\{Fanfare\}\
\
\{Yawns\}\
\
-What'd I miss? What'd I miss?\
\
\{Muffled\}\
\
-Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.\
\
-Princess Fiona.\
\
-As promised. Now hand it over.\
\
-Very well, orge. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.\
\
-Take it and go before I change my mind.\
\
-Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I \
\
have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I'm Lord Farquaad.\
\
-Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.\
\
\{Snaps fingers\}\
\
-Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... farewell.\
\
-Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the \
\
orge. It's not like it has feelings.\
\
-No, you're right. It doesn't.\
\
-Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawerss Fiona. I ask your hand in \
\
marriage.\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
-Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?\
\
-Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make - - \
\
-Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!\
\
-No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun \
\
sets.\
\
-Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's \
\
so much to do! Threre's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest \
\
list. Captain, round up some guests!\
\
-Fare-thee-well, orge.\
\
-Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.\
\
-Yeah? So what?\
\
-Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to \
\
her last night, She's - - \
\
-I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? \
\
Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?\
\
-Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.\
\
-I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! \
\
My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, \
\
pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!\
\
-But I thought - - \
\
-Yeah. You know what? You tought wrong!\
\
-Shrek.\
\
\
\
I heard there was a secret chord\
\
That David played and it pleased the Lord\
\
But you don't really care for music, do ya\
\
It goes like this the fourth, the fifth\
\
The minor fall the major lift\
\
The baffled king composing hallelujah\
\
Hallelujah,  hallelujah\
\
Baby, I've been here before\
\
I know this room I've walked this floor\
\
I used to live alone before I knew you\
\
I've seen your flag on the marble arch\
\
But love is not a victory march\
\
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah\
\
Hallelujah,  hallelujah\
\
And all I ever learned from love\
\
Is how to shoot at someone\
\
Who outdrew you\
\
\{Moaning\}\
\
And it's not a cry you can hear at night\
\
It's not somebody who's seen the light\
\
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah\
\
\{Moaning\}\
\
Hallelujah,  hallelujah\
\
\
\
\{Thumping sound\}\
\
-Donkey?\
\
\{Grunts\}\
\
-What are you doing?\
\
-I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see \
\
one.\
\
-Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not \
\
through it.\
\
-It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.\
\
-Oh! Your half. Hmm.\
\
-Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I \
\
get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks \
\
like your head.\
\
-Back off!\
\
-No, you back off.\
\
-This is my swamp!\
\
-Our swamp.\
\
-Let go, Donkey!\
\
-You let go.\
\
-Stubborn jackass!\
\
-Smelly orge.\
\
-Fine!\
\
-Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.\
\
-Well, I'm through with you.\
\
-Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess \
\
what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are \
\
mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! \
\
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.\
\
-Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?\
\
-Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!\
\
-Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in \
\
the back!\
\
-Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your \
\
own feelings.\
\
-Go away!\
\
-There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she \
\
ever do was like you, maybe even love you.\
\
-Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of \
\
you talking. \
\
-She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody \
\
else.\
\
-She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?\
\
-Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. \
\
Right? Right?\
\
-Donkey!\
\
-No!\
\
-Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?\
\
\{Sighs\}\
\
-I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge. Can you \
\
forgive me?\
\
-Hey, that's what friends are for, right?\
\
-Right. Friends?\
\
-Friends.\
\
-So, um, what did Fiona say about me?\
\
-What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?\
\
-The wedding! We'll never make it in time.\
\
-Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I \
\
have a way.\
\
\{Whistles\}\
\
-Donkey?\
\
-I guess it's just my animal magnetism.\
\
\{Laughing\}\
\
-Aw, come here, you.\
\
-All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. \
\
All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install \
\
the seat belts yet.\
\
-Whoo!\
\
\{Bells tolling\}\
\
\{All gasping\}\
\
-People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the union....\
\
-Um-\
\
-of our new king - -\
\
-Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?\
\
\{Chuckling\}\
\
-Go on.\
\
-Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about \
\
that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't \
\
you?\
\
-What are you talking about?\
\
-There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak \
\
now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!"\
\
-I don't have time for this!\
\
-Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this \
\
woman, don't you?\
\
-Yes.\
\
-You wanna hold her?\
\
-Yes.\
\
-Please her?\
\
-Yes!\
\
-Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. The chicks love that \
\
romantic crap!\
\
-All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?\
\
-We gotta check it out.\
\
\
\
-And so, by the power vested in me, \
\
-What do you see?\
\
-The whole town's in there.\
\
-I now pronounce you husband and wife,\
\
-They're at the altar.\
\
-king and queen.\
\
-Mother Fletcher! He already said it.\
\
-Oh, for the love of Pete!\
\
\{Grunts\}\
\
-I object!\
\
-Shrek?\
\
\{Gasps\}\
\
-Oh, now what does he want?\
\
-Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first at all. \
\
Very clean.\
\
-What are you doing here?\
\
-Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but \
\
showing up uninvited to a wedding - -\
\
-Fiona! I need to talk to you.\
\
-Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll \
\
excuse me - - \
\
-But you can't marry him.\
\
-And why not?\
\
-Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king.\
\
-Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.\
\
-He's not your true love.\
\
-And what do you know about true love?\
\
-Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - - \
\
-Oh, this is precious. The orge has fallen in love with the princess! \
\
Oh, good Lord.\
\
\{Crowd laughting\}\
\
-An orge and a princess!\
\
-Shrek, is this true?\
\
-Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away \
\
from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! Mmmmm!\
\
-"By night one way, by day another." I wanted to show you before.\
\
\{Whimpers\}\
\
\{Crown gasping\}\
\
-Well, uh, that explains a lot.\
\
-Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of \
\
my sight now! Get them! Get them both!\
\
-No, no!\
\
-Shrek!\
\
-This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that \
\
makes me king! See? See?\
\
-No, let go of me! Shrek!\
\
-No!\
\
-Don't just stand there, you morons.\
\
-Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh! \
\
-I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and \
\
quartered!\
\
-You'll beg for death to save you!\
\
-No, Shrek!\
\
-And as for you, my wife,\
\
-Fiona!\
\
-I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!\
\
-I'm king!\
\
\{Whistles\}\
\
-I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have - - Aaaah!\
\
-Aah!\
\
-All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to \
\
use it.\
\
\{Roars\}\
\
-I'm a donkey on the edge!\
\
\{Belches\}\
\
-Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?\
\
\{Cheering\}\
\
-Go ahead, Shrek.\
\
-Uh, Fiona?\
\
-Yes, Shrek?\
\
-I - - I love you.\
\
-Really?\
\
-Really, really.\
\
- I love you too.\
\
-Aawww!\
\
-"Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true \
\
form."\
\
-"Take love's true form. Take love's true form."\
\
-Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?\
\
-Well, yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.\
\
-But you ARE beautiful.\
\
\{Chuckles\}\
\
-I was hoping this would be a happy ending.\
\
\
\
I thought love was only true in fairy tales\
\
Oy!\
\
Meant for someone else but not for me\
\
Love was out to get me\
\
That's the way it seemed\
\
Disappointment haunted all my dreams\
\
And then I saw her face\
\
Now I'm a believer and not a trace\
\
Of doubt in my mind\
\
I'm in love\
\
Ooh-aah\
\
I'm a believer I couldn't leave her\
\
If I tried\

\
Then I saw her face\

\
-Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh.\
\
-I can't breathe. I can't breathe. \
\
\
\
I believe in self-assertion\
\
Destiny or a slight diversion\
\
Now it seems I've got my head on straight\
\
I'm a freak an apparition\
\
Seems I've made the right decision\
\
To try to turn back now it might be too late\

So let's be together\

Oh, girl, I'm so thankful\

You always consider me\

And treat me like a Nostradamus\

\
I break a little something\
\
to keep my mind on\

\f1\fs28 \cf3 \cb4 \strokec3 Once upon a time in a kingdom far, far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. And throughout the land, everyone was happy... until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss... of the handsome Prince Charming. It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon's keep. For he was the bravest, and most handsome... in all the land. And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse. He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess's chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her... What? - Princess... Fiona? - No! Oh, thank heavens. Where is she? - She's on her honeymoon. - Honeymoon? With whom? - She's on her honeymoon. - Honeymoon? With whom? So she said what's the problem, baby? What's the problem? I don't know Well, maybe I'm in love Think about it every time I think 'bout it Can't stop thinking 'bout it How much longer will it take to cure this? Just to cure it, 'cause I can't ignore it If it's love, love Makes me wanna turn around and face me But I don't know nothing 'bout love Oh, come on, come on - Turn a little faster Come on, come on The world will follow after Come on, come on Everybody's after love So I said I'm a snowball running Running down into this spring that's coming all this love Melting under blue skies belting out sunlight Shimmering love Well, baby, I surrender To the strawberry ice cream Never ever end of all this love Well, I didn't mean to do it But there's no escaping your love These lines of lightning mean we're never alone Never alone, no, no Come on, come on Jump a little higher Come on, come on If you feel a little lighter Come on, come on We were once upon a time in love Hyah! We're accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally in love Accidentally I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love I'm in love, I'm in love Accidentally in love I'm in love I'm in love lt's so good to be home! Just you and me and... - Two can be as bad as one... - Donkey? Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two a sight for sore eyes! Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine. And look at you, Mrs. Shrek. How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed? Donkey, what are you doing here? Taking care of your love nest for you. Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail and watering the plants? - Yeah, and feeding the fish! - l don't have any fish. You do now. l call that one Shrek and the other Fiona. That Shrek is a rascally devil. Get your... Look at the time. l guess you'd better be going. Don't you want to tell me about your trip? Or how about a game of Parcheesi? Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be getting home to Dragon? Oh, yeah, that. l don't know. She's been all moody and stuff lately. l thought l'd move in with you. You know we're always happy to see you, Donkey. But Fiona and l are married now. We need a little time, you know, to be together. Just with each other. Alone. Say no more. You don't have to worry about a thing. l will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you. - Donkey! - Yes, roomie? You're bothering me. Oh, OK. All right, cool. l guess... Me and Pinocchio was going to catch a tournament, anyway, so... Maybe l'll see y'all Sunday for a barbecue or something. He'll be fine. Now, where were we? Oh. l think l remember. - Donkey! l know, l know! Alone! l'm going! l'm going. What do you want me to tell these other guys? Enough, Reggie. ''Dearest Princess Fiona. ''You are hereby summoned to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away ''for a royal ball in celebration of your marriage ''at which time the King ''will bestow his royal blessing... upon you and your...'' uh... ''Prince Charming. ''Love, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away. ''aka Mom and Dad.'' Mom and Dad? - Prince Charming? - Royal ball? Can l come? - We're not going. - What? l mean, don't you think they might be a bit... shocked to see you like this? Well, they might be a bit surprised. But they're my parents, Shrek. They love me. And don't worry. They'll love you, too. Yeah, right. Somehow l don't think l'll be welcome at the country club. Stop it. They're not like that. How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band? Oh, come on! You could at least give them a chance. To do what? Sharpen their pitchforks? No! They just want to give you their blessing. Oh, great. Now l need their blessing? lf you want to be a part of this family, yes! Who says l want to be part of this family? You did! When you married me! Well, there's some fine print for you! So that's it. You won't come? Trust me. lt's a bad idea. We are not going! And that's final! Come on! We don't want to hit traffic! Don't worry! We'll take care of everything. - Hey, wait for me. Oof! Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up! Rawhide! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Rawhide! Ride 'em up! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide! Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead! Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks! Meet their mamas! Milk 'em hard! Rawhide! Yee-haw! - Are we there yet? - No. - Are we there yet? - Not yet. - OK, are we there yet? - No. - Are we there yet? - No! - Are we there yet? - Yes. - Really? - No! - Are we there yet? - No! - Are we there yet? - We are not! - Are we there yet? - No! - Are we there yet? - That's not funny. That's really immature. - This is why nobody likes ogres. - Your loss! - l'm gonna just stop talking. - Finally! This is taking forever, Shrek. There's no in-flight movie or nothing! The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey. That's where we're going. Far, far... away! All right, all right, l get it. l'm just so darn bored. Well, find a way to entertain yourself. For five minutes... Could you not be yourself... ...for five minutes! Are we there yet? - Yes! - Oh, finally! Wow! lt's going to be champagne wishes and caviar dreams from now on. Hey, good-looking! We'll be back to pick you up later! Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me We are definitely not in the swamp anymore. Halt! Well, I talk about it, talk about it, talk about it, talk about it Hey, everyone, look. Talk about, talk about movin'... Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh? You working that hat. Swimming pools! Movie stars! Announcing the long-awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband. Well, this is it. - This is it. - This is it. This is it. Uh... why don't you guys go ahead? l'll park the car. So... you still think this was a good idea? Of course! Look. Mom and Dad look happy to see us. - Who on earth are they? - l think that's our little girl. That's not little! That's a really big problem. Wasn't she supposed to kiss Prince Charming and break the spell? Well, he's no Prince Charming, but they do look... Happy now? We came. We saw them. Now let's go before they light the torches. - They're my parents. - Hello? They locked you in a tower. That was for my own... Good! Here's our chance. Let's go back inside and pretend we're not home. Harold, we have to be... Quick! While they're not looking we can make a run for it. Shrek, stop it! Everything's gonna be... A disaster! There is no way... - You can do this. - l really... - Really... - don't... want... to... be... Here! Mom... Dad... l'd like you to meet my husband... Shrek. Well, um... lt's easy to see where Fiona gets her good looks from. - Excuse me. Better out than in, l always say, eh, Fiona? That's good. l guess not. What do you mean, ''not on the list''? Don't tell me you don't know who l am. What do you mean, ''not on the list''? Don't tell me you don't know who l am. What's happening, everybody? Thanks for waiting. - l had the hardest time finding this place. - No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down! No, Dad! lt's all right. lt's all right. He's with us. - He helped rescue me from the dragon. - That's me: the noble steed. Waiter! How 'bout a bowl for the steed? Oh, boy. - Um, Shrek? - Yeah? Oh, sorry! Great soup, Mrs Q. Mmm! No, no. Darling. Oh! So, Fiona, tell us about where you live. Well... Shrek owns his own land. - Don't you, honey? - Oh, yes! lt's in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and... What? l know you ain't talking about the swamp. An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original. l suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children. lt's a bit early to be thinking about that, isn't it? - lndeed. l just started eating. - Harold! - What's that supposed to mean? - Dad. lt's great, OK? - For his type, yes. - My type? l got to go to the bathroom. - Dinner is served! - Never mind. l can hold it. Bon appetit! Oh, Mexican food! My favorite. Let's not sit here with our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in. Don't mind if l do, Lillian. l suppose any grandchildren l could expect from you would be... Ogres, yes! Not that there's anything wrong with that. Right, Harold? Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is, assuming you don't eat your own young! Dad! No, we usually prefer the ones who've been locked away in a tower! - Shrek, please! - l only did that because l love her. Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle. You wouldn't understand. You're not her father! lt's so nice to have the family together for dinner. - Harold! - Shrek! - Fiona! - Fiona! - Mom! - Harold... Donkey! Your fallen tears have called to me So, here comes my sweet remedy I know what every princess needs For her to live life happily... Oh, my dear. Oh, look at you. You're all grown up. - Who are you? - Oh, sweet pea! l'm your fairy godmother. - l have a fairy godmother? - Shush, shush. Now, don't worry. l'm here to make it all better. With just a... Wave of my magic wand Your troubles will soon be gone With a flick of the wrist and just a flash You'll land a prince with a ton of cash A high-priced dress made by mice no less Some crystal glass pumps And no more stress Your worries will vanish, your soul will cleanse Confide in your very own furniture friends We'll help you set a new fashion trend - I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great - The kind of girl a prince would date!

Nip and tuck, here and there To land that prince with the perfect hair Stop! Look... Thank you very much, Fairy Godmother, but l really don't need all this. - Fine. Be that way. - We didn't like you, anyway. - Fiona? Fiona? Oh! You got a puppy? All l got in my room was shampoo. Oh, uh... Fairy Godmother, furniture... l'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek. Your husband? What? What did you say? When did this happen? Shrek is the one who rescued me. - But that can't be right. - Oh, great, more relatives! She's just trying to help. Good! She can help us pack. Get your coat, dear. We're leaving. - What? - l don't want to leave. When did you decide this? - Shortly after arriving. - Look, l'm sorry... No, that's all right. l need to go, anyway. But remember, dear. lf you should ever need me... happiness... is just a teardrop away. Thanks, but we've got all the happiness we need. Happy, happy, happy... So l see. Let's go, Kyle. - Very nice, Shrek. - What? l told you coming here was a bad idea. You could've at least tried to get along with my father. l don't think l was going to get Daddy's blessing, even if l did want it. Do you think it might be nice if somebody asked me what l wanted? Sure. Do you want me to pack for you? You're unbelievable! You're behaving like a... - Go on! Say it! - Like an ogre! Here's a news flash for you! Whether your parents like it or not... l am an ogre! And guess what, Princess? That's not about to change. l've made changes for you, Shrek. Think about that. That's real smooth, Shrek. ''l'm an ogre!'' l knew this would happen. You should. You started it. l can hardly believe that, Lillian. He's the ogre. Not me. l think, Harold, you're taking this a little too personally. This is Fiona's choice. But she was supposed to choose the prince we picked for her. l mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this... thing? Fiona does. And she'll never forgive you if you don't. l don't want to lose our daughter again, Harold. Oh, you act as if love is totally predictable. Don't you remember when we were young? We used to walk down by the lily pond and... - they were in bloom... - Our first kiss. lt's not the same! l don't think you realize that our daughter has married a monster! Oh, stop being such a drama king. Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong! La, di, da, di, da! lsn't it all wonderful! l'd like to know how it could get any worse! - Hello, Harold. - What happened? - Nothing, dear! Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit! l'll just stretch it out here for a while. You better get in. We need to talk. Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed. Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy. So, how about... we make this a quick visit. What? Oh, hello. Ha-ha-ha! So, what's new? You remember my son, Prince Charming? ls that you? My gosh! lt's been years. When did you get back? Oh, about five minutes ago, actually. After l endured blistering winds, scorching desert... l climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower... Mommy can handle this. He endures blistering winds and scorching desert! He climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower... And what does he find? Some gender-confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married. lt wasn't my fault. He didn't get there in time. Stop the car! Harold. You force me to do something l really don't want to do. Where are we? Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy! May l take your order? My diet is ruined! l hope you're happy. Er... okay. Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili rings... - l'll have the Medieval Meal. - One Medieval Meal and, Harold... - Curly fries? - No, thank you. - Sourdough soft taco, then? - No, really, l'm fine. Your order, Fairy Godmother. This comes with the Medieval Meal. There you are, dear. We made a deal, Harold, and l assume you don't want me to go back on my part. lndeed not. So, Fiona and Charming will be together. - Yes. - Believe me, Harold. lt's what's best. Not only for your daughter... but for your Kingdom. What am l supposed to do about it? Use your imagination. Oh... Come on in, Your Majesty. I like my town With a little drop of poison Nobody knows... Excuse me. Do l know you? No, you must be mistaking me for someone else. Uh... excuse me. l'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister. Ah! There you are. Right. You see, l need to have someone taken care of. - Who's the guy? - Well, he's not a guy, per se. Um... He's an ogre. Hey, buddy, let me clue you in. There's only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly... he don't like to be disturbed. he don't like to be disturbed. Where could l find him? Hello? Who dares enter my room? Sorry! l hope l'm not interrupting, but l'm told you're the one to talk to about an ogre problem? You are told correct. But for this, l charge a great deal of money. Would... this be enough? You have engaged my valuable services, Your Majesty. Just tell me where l can find this ogre. Everyone says I'm getting down too low Everyone says you've just gotta let it go You just gotta let it go I need some sleep Time to put the old horse down I'm in too deep And the wheels keep spinning round Everyone says you've just gotta let it go Everyone says you've just gotta let it go Dear Knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. Dear Diary... Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can't go. He never lets me out after sunset. Dad says I'm going away for a while. Must be like some finishing school. Mom says that when I'm old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family, and we'll all live happily ever after. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Sorry. l hope l'm not interrupting anything. No, no. l was just reading a, uh... a scary book. l was hoping you'd let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier. - Okay... - l don't know what came over me. Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over... - Look, Your Majesty, l just... - Please. Call me Dad. Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other. Excellent idea! l was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt. A little father-son time? l know it would mean the world to Fiona. Shall we say, Face it, Donkey! We're lost. We can't be lost. We followed the King's instructions exactly. ''Head to the darkest part of the woods...'' ''Past the sinister trees with scary-looking branches.'' - The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey! - We passed that three times already! You were the one who said not to stop for directions. Oh, great. My one chance to fix things up with Fiona's dad and l end up lost in the woods with you! Don't get huffy! l'm only trying to help. l know! l know. - l'm sorry, all right? - Hey, don't worry about it. l just really need to make things work with this guy. Yeah, sure. Now let's go bond with Daddy. Well, well, well, Donkey. l know it was kind of a tender moment back there, but the purring? What? l ain't purring. Sure. What's next? A hug? Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr. What do you think l am, some kind of a... Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare! Look! A little cat. - Look out, Shrek! He got a piece! - lt's a cat, Donkey. Come here, little kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty. Come here. Oh! Come here, little kitty. - Whoa! - Hold on, Shrek! l'm coming! - Come on! Get it off! Get it off! Oh, God. Oh... No! - Look out, Shrek! Hold still! - Get it off! Shrek! Hold still! - Did l miss? - No. You got them. Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from... Puss... in Boots! l'll kill that cat! Ah-ha-ha! Hairball. - Oh! That is nasty! What should we do with him? Take the sword and neuter him. Give him the Bob Barker treatment. Oh, no! Por favor! Please! l implore you! lt was nothing personal, Senor. l was doing it only for my family. My mother, she is sick. And my father lives off the garbage! The King offered me much in gold and l have a litter of brothers... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Fiona's father paid you to do this? The rich King? Si. Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing. Don't feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you. Gee, thanks. Maybe Fiona would've been better off if l were some sort of Prince Charming. That's what the King said. Oh, uh... sorry. l thought that question was directed at me. Shrek, Fiona knows you'd do anything for her. Well, it's not like l wouldn't change if l could. l just... l just wish l could make her happy. Hold the phone... ''Happiness.'' ''A tear drop away.'' Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that's ever happened to you! Aw, man, where do l begin? First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans. Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me. Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going ''Pinata!!'' What is a pinata, anyway? No, Donkey! l need you to cry! Don't go projecting on me. l know you're feeling bad, but you got to... Aaaahhh! You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of... What? Is it on? Is it on? This is Fairy Godmother. I'm either away from my desk or with a client. But if you come by the office, we'll be glad to make you an appointment. Have a ''happy ever after. '' Oh... Are you up for a little quest, Donkey? That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure! Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo! We're on the move! - Stop, Ogre! l have misjudged you. - Join the club. We've got jackets. On my honor, l am obliged to accompany you until l have saved your life as you have spared me mine. The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken. Let's go, Shrek. Shrek? - Shrek! - Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him... in his wee little boots. You know, how many cats can wear boots? Honestly. - Let's keep him! - Say what? Ahh! Listen. He's purring! - Oh, so now it's cute. - Come on, Donkey. Lighten up. Lighten up? l should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! Lighten up? l should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! Shrek! Shrek? They're both festive, aren't they? What do you think, Harold? Um... Yes, yes. Fine. Fine. Try to at least pretend you're interested in your daughter's wedding ball. Honestly, Lillian, l don't think it matters. How do we know there will even be a ball? Mom. Dad. - Oh, hello, dear. - What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming. Mom, have you seen Shrek? l haven't. You should ask your father. Be sure and use small words, dear. He's a little slow this morning. - Can l help you, Your Majesty? - Ah, yes! Um... Mmm! Exquisite. What do you call this dish? That would be the dog's breakfast, Your Majesty. Ah, yes. Very good, then. Carry on, Cedric. - Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek? - No, l haven't, dear. l'm sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in. You know, after your little spat last night. Oh. You heard that, huh? The whole kingdom heard you. l mean, after all, it is in his nature to be... well, a bit of a brute. Him? You know, you didn't exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon. Well, what did you expect? Look at what he's done to you. Shrek loves me for who l am. l would think you'd be happy for me. Darling, l'm just thinking about what's best for you. Maybe you should do the same. No, really? Shh... Oh... Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place. Let's back away slowly. That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage. She's the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom. Then why don't we pop in there for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell! He makes me laugh. Hi. l'm here to see the... The Fairy Godmother. l'm sorry. She is not in. Jerome! Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now! Yes, Fairy Godmother. Right away. Look, she's not seeing any clients today, OK? That's OK, buddy. We're from the union. The union? We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign. Oh! Oh, right. Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed? Uh... a little. We don't even have dental. They don't even have dental. Okay, we'll just have a look around. Oh. By the way. l think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother didn't know we were here. - Know what l'm saying? Huh? - Huh? Huh? Huh? - Stop it. - Of course. Go right in. A drop of desire. Naughty! A pinch of passion. And just a hint of... lust! Excuse me. Sorry to barge in like this... What in Grimm's name are you doing here? Well, it seems that Fiona's not exactly happy. Oh-ho-ho! And there's some question as to why that is? Well, let's explore that, shall we? Ah. P, P, P... Princess. Cinderella. Here we are. ''Lived happily ever after.'' Oh... No ogres! Let's see. Snow White. A handsome prince. Oh, no ogres. Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres! Hansel and Gretel? No! Thumbelina? No. The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman... No, no, no, no, no! You see, ogres don't live happily ever after. All right, look, lady! Don't you point... those dirty green sausages at me! Your Monte Cristo and coffee. Oh! Sorry. Ah... that's okay. We were just leaving. Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother. Just... go. Come on, guys. TGlF, eh, buddy? Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac? Get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face! Man, that stinks! You don't exactly smell like a basket of roses. - Well, one of these has got to help. - l was just concocting this very plan! Already our minds are becoming one. Whoa, whoa. lf we need an expert on licking ourselves, we'll give you a call. Shrek, this is a bad idea. Look. Make yourself useful and go keep watch. Puss, do you think you could get to those on top? No problema, boss. ln one of my nine lives, l was the great cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Shrek, are you off your nut? Donkey, keep watch. Keep watch? Yeah, l'll keep watch. l'll watch that wicked witch come and whammy a world of hurt up your backside. l'll laugh, too. l'll be giggling to myself. - What do you see? - Toad Stool Softener? l'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems. - Elfa Seltzer? - Uh-uh. - Hex Lax? - No!

He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me! Oh, put it away, Junior! You're still going to be king. We'll just have to come up with something smarter. Pardon. Um... Everything is accounted for, Fairy Godmother, except for one potion. What? Oh... l do believe we can make this work to our advantage. ''Happily Ever After Potion. Maximum strength. ''For you and your true love. ''lf one of you drinks this, you both will be fine. ''Happiness, comfort and beauty divine.'' - You both will be fine? - l guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too. Hey, man, this don't feel right. My donkey senses are tingling all over. Drop that jug o' voodoo and let's get out of here. lt says, ''Beauty Divine.'' How bad can it be? See, you're allergic to that stuff. You'll have a reaction. And if you think that l'll be smearing Vapor Rub over your chest, think again! Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion... allow me to take the first sip. lt would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you. Oh, no, no. l don't think so. lf there'll be any animal testing, l'll do it. That's the best friend's job. Now give me that bottle. How do you feel? l don't feel any different. l look any different? You still look like an ass to me. Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys. - Well, here's to us, Fiona. - Shrek? - You drink that, there's no going back. - l know. - No more wallowing in the mud? - l know. - No more itchy butt crack? - l know! - But you love being an ogre! - l know! But l love Fiona more. Shrek, no! Wait! Got to be... l think you grabbed the ''Farty Ever After'' potion. Maybe it's a dud. Or maybe Fiona and l were never meant to be.

Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy. l'm melting! l'm melting! lt's just the rain, Donkey. Oh. Don't worry. Things seem bad because it's dark and rainy and Fiona's father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you. lt'll be better in the morning. You'll see... The sun'll come out... Tomorrow Bet your bottom... Bet my bottom? l'm coming, Elizabeth! Donkey? Are you all right? - Hey, boss. Let's shave him. - D-Donkey? There you are! We missed you at dinner. What is it, darling? Dad... l've been thinking about what you said. And l'm going to set things right. Ah! Excellent! That's my girl. lt was a mistake to bring Shrek here. l'm going to go out and find him. And then we'll go back to the swamp where we belong. Fiona, please! Let's not be rash, darling. You can't go anywhere right now. Fiona! Look, l told you he was here. Look at him! Quiet. Look at him. Good morning, sleepyhead. Good morning! We love your kitty! Oh... My head... - Here, l fetched a pail of water. Thanks. Uhh! Aahh! Oh... A cute button nose? Thick, wavy locks? Taut, round buttocks? l'm... l'm... - Gorgeous! - l'll say. l'm Jill. What's your name? - Um... Shrek. - Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe? - You're tense. - l want to rub his shoulders. - l got it covered. - l don't have anything to rub. Get in line. Get in line. - Have you seen my donkey? - Who are you calling donkey? - Donkey? You're a... - A stallion, baby! l can whinny. l can count. Look at me, Shrek! l'm trotting! That's some quality potion. What's in that stuff? ''Oh, don't take the potion, Mr. Boss, it's very bad.'' Pah! ''Warning: Side effects may include burning, itching, oozing, weeping. ''Not intended for heart patients or those with... nervous disorders.'' l'm trotting, l'm trotting in place! Yeah! What? Senor? ''To make the effects of this potion permanent, ''the drinker must obtain his true love's kiss by midnight.'' Midnight? Why is it always midnight? - Pick me! l'll be your true love! - l'll be your true love. l'll be true... enough. Look, ladies, l already have a true love. Oh... And take it from me, Boss. You are going to have one satisfied Princess. And let's face it. You are a lot easier on the eyes. lnside you're the same old mean, salty... - Easy. - ...cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been. And you're still the same annoying donkey. - Yeah. Well... Look out, Princess. Here comes the new me. First things first. - We need to get you out of those clothes. - Ready? - Ready! - Driver, stop! Oh, God! Help me, please! My racing days are over! l'm blind! Tell the truth. Will l ever play the violin again? You poor creature! ls there anything l can do for you? Well, l guess there is one thing.

Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir Shrek, is here to see her.

Hello, handsome. Shrek! - Princess! - Donkey? Wow! That potion worked on you, too? What potion? Shrek and l took some magic potion. And well... Now, we're sexy! Shrek? For you, baby... l could be. - Yeah, you wish. - Donkey, where is Shrek? He went inside looking for you. Shrek? Fiona! Fiona! You want to dance, pretty boy? Are you going so soon? Don't you want to see your wife? Fiona? Shrek? Aye, Fiona. lt is me. What happened to your voice? The potion changed a lot of things, Fiona. But not the way l feel about you. Fiona? - Charming? - Do you think so? Dad. l was so hoping you'd approve. - Um... Who are you? - Mom, it's me, Shrek. l know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think? Fiona! Fiona! Fiona! - Fiona! - Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho! Oh, shoot! l don't think they can hear us, pigeon. Don't you think you've already messed her life up enough? l just wanted her to be happy. And now she can be. Oh, sweetheart. She's finally found the prince of her dreams. But look at me. Look what l've done for her. lt's time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek. She's a princess, and you're an ogre. That's something no amount of potion will ever change. But... l love her. lf you really love her... you'll let her go. Shrek? Senor. What's going on? Where are you going? You wouldn't have had anything to do with this, would you, Harold? People just ain't no good I think that's well understood There you go, boys. Just leave the bottle, Doris. Hey. Why the long face? lt was all just a stupid mistake. l never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place. l hate Mondays. l can't believe you'd walk away from the best thing that happened to you. What choice do l have? She loves that pretty boy, Prince Charming. Come on. ls he really that good-looking? Are you kidding? He's gorgeous! He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels. - Oh. He sounds dreamy. - You know... shockingly, this isn't making me feel any better. Look, guys. lt's for the best. Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she's always dreamed of. Everybody wins. Except for you. l don't get it, Shrek. You love Fiona. Aye. And that's why l have to let her go. Excuse me, is she here? She's, uh... in the back. Oh, hello again. Fairy Godmother. Charming. You'd better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold. Well, l'm afraid Fiona isn't really... warming up to Prince Charming. - FYl, not my fault. - No, of course it's not, dear. l mean, how charming can l be when l have to pretend l'm that dreadful ogre? No, no, it's nobody's fault. Perhaps it's best if we just call the whole thing off, okay? - What? - You can't force someone to fall in love! l beg to differ. l do it all the time! Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming. - Umm... no. - What did you say? l can't. l won't do it. Oh, yes, you will. lf you remember, l helped you with your happily ever after. And l can take it away just as easily. ls that what you want? ls it? - No. - Good boy. Now, we have to go. l need to do Charming's hair before the ball. He's hopeless. He's all high in the front. He can never get to the back. You need someone to do the back. Oh. Thank you, Mother. Mother? Um... Mary! A talking horse! The ogre! Stop them! Thieves! Bandits! Stop them! The abs are fab and it's gluteus to the maximus here at tonight's Far, Far Away Royal Ball blowout!

The whole Kingdom's turned out to celebrate your marriage. There's just one problem. That's not my husband. l mean, look at him. Yes, he is a bit different, but people change for the ones they love. You'd be surprised how much l changed for your mother. Change? He's completely lost his mind! Why not come down to the ball and give him another chance? You might find you like this new Shrek. But it's the old one l fell in love with, Dad. l'd give anything to have him back. Darling. That's mine. Decaf. Otherwise l'm up all night. Thanks. l got to get out of here! l got to get out of here! You can't lock us up like this! Let me go! What about my Miranda rights? You're supposed to say l have the right to remain silent. Nobody said l have the right to remain silent! You have the right to remain silent. What you lack is the capacity. l must hold on before l, too, go totally mad. Shrek? Donkey? Too late. Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here! Oh... Fire in ze hole! Look out below! Quick! Tell a lie! - What should l say? - Anything, but quick! Say something crazy like ''l'm wearing ladies' underwear!'' l am wearing ladies' underwear. - Are you? - l most certainly am not! lt looks like you most certainly am are! - l am not! - What kind? - lt's a thong! - Oww!

\f1\fs28 \cf3 \cb5 \strokec3 Once upon a time, a long time ago, a king and queen had a beautiful daughter named Fiona. But she was possessed by a terrible curse. By day, a lovely princess. By night, a hideous ogre. Only true love\'92s kiss could lift her curse. So Fiona waited in a tower, guarded by a dragon, until the day when her true love would arrive. But as the days turned into years, the King and Queen were forced to resort to more desperate measures. Whoa, there.\
King Harold: I don\'92t know about this, Lillian. Fairy Godmother said only true love\'92s kiss could break Fiona\'92s curse. I don\'92t trust that woman, Harold. This may be our last hope. Besides, he does come highly recommended by King Midas.\
King Harold; But to put our daughter\'92s life in the hands of this\'85 person? He\'92s devious. He\'92s deceitful. He\'92s, he\'92s\'85\
Rumpelstiltskin: Rumpelstiltskin! Mrs. Highness. How do you do? Down, Fifi. Get down! As you can see, everything\'92s in order. So you\'92ll put an end to our daughter\'92s curse? And, in return, you sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to me. - Lillian, this is madness! - What choice do we have? Fiona has been locked away in that tower far too long. It\'92s not like she\'92s getting any younger. But to sign over our entire kingdom? Well, if your kingdom\'92s worth more to you than your daughter\'85 Nothing is worth more to us than our daughter. Jump, Fifi, jump! Just sign it and all your problems will disappear. Your Highness! The Princess! She\'92s been saved! Who saved her? No one would have guessed that an ogre named Shrek, whose roar was feared throughout the land, would save the beautiful Princess Fiona. True love\'92s kiss led to marriage and ogre babies! The kingdom of Far Far Away was finally at peace. Goody for them! And they lived happily ever after! Sir? You\'92re gonna have to pay for that. Maybe we could make a deal for it, little boy? - Oh, I\'92m not a real boy. - Do you want to be? Nobody needs your deals anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants! I wish that ogre was never born! Wake up, Daddy, wake up! - Good morning. - Good morning to you. Better out than in.\

\cf3 \cb5 - Unbelievable. - Tell me about it! Those villagers\'85 I\'92m not talking about the villagers, Shrek. I\'92m talking about you. Is this really how you want to remember the kids\'92 first birthday? - Oh, great. So this is all my fault? - Yes. But you know what? Let\'92s talk about this after the party, at home. You mean that roadside attraction we live in? Step right up! See the dancing ogre! Don\'92t worry! He won\'92t bite! I used to be an ogre. Now I\'92m just a jolly green joke! OK, OK, maybe you\'92re not the ogre you used to be. But maybe that\'92s not such a bad thing. I wouldn\'92t expect you to understand. It\'92s not like you\'92re a real ogre. You spent half your life in a palace. And the other half locked away in a tower. Look, all I want is for things to go back to the way they used to be! Back when villagers were afraid of me, and I could take a mud bath in peace. When I could do what I wanted, when I wanted to do it! Back when the world made sense! You mean back before you rescued me from the Dragon\'92s Keep? Exactly! Shrek, you have three beautiful children, a wife who loves you, friends who adore you. You have everything. Why is it the only person who can\'92t see that is you? That\'92s just great. If she thinks I\'92m gonna slink back there and apologize, she\'92s got another thing coming. She\'92s not the boss of me. I\'92m an ogre and I\'92m not gonna apologize for acting like one. Help, please! Someone, anyone at all, help me! Please, help! Please, help! I\'92m stuck! Help! Oh, please, help! Someone, anyone! Help me! The pain! I can see a bright light. A tunnel! Grandma? Is that you? Yeah, it\'92s me, Granny. An ogre! Please, Mr. Ogre, please don\'92t eat me! I\'92m not gonna eat you. But you are an ogre\'85 Aren\'92t you? Yeah, well, I\'85 I used to be. Look, move out or get crushed. So you\'92re not gonna eat me? No, thanks. I already had a big bowl of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast. Wait up! What\'92s your rush? Where you going? Nowhere. What a coincidence! I was just heading that way myself. But, seriously, let me give you a ride. I insist. Come on. It\'92s the least I can do after all you\'92ve done for me. I got a hot rat cooking. All right! Can I interest you in a mudslide? Slug and tonic? A liquid libation to ease that frustration? - Eyeball-tini? - Well, maybe just one. So the centaur says, "That\'92s not the half I\'92m talking about. " I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you. To live the life of an ogre\'85 no worries, no responsibilities. You are free to pillage and terrorize as you please. - Free? That\'92s a laugh. - Oh, yeah? Sometimes I wish I had just one day to feel like a real ogre again. Why didn\'92t you say so? Magical transactions are my specialty! Great. Next to mimes, magicians are my favourite people. Hold on. "King for a Month. " "Knight for a Week. " Ogre for a day. Think about it, Shrek. To be feared and hated. You\'92ll be, like, "Roar!" And the villagers will be, like, "Get away! It\'92s Shrek! I\'92m so scared of him!" It would be just like the good old days, when your swamp was your castle. - When the world made sense. - All right, what\'92s the catch? Catch? No. There\'92s no catch. No catchings, really. I mean, there\'92s something. Small thing. Nothing. A little thing. All right, I knew it. So what do you want? - A day. - A day. Rat\'92s done! To make the magic work, you gotta give something to get something. In this case, you gotta give a day to get a day. That\'92s all. I can\'92t just pick up and leave my family. But that\'92s the best part, Shrek! It\'92s a magical contract. No one will even know you\'92re gone. And by the time this day is up, you are gonna feel like a changed ogre. Still, I don\'92t know. Hey, no problem. Forget it, no big D. Doesn\'92t matter. Do you like white meat or dark meat? So what day would I have to give up? I don\'92t know, any day. A day from your past. A day you had the flu? A day you lost a pet? A day some meddling oaf stuck his nose where it didn\'92t belong destroying your business and ruining your life?! Just for an example. How about the day I met Donkey? Now, there\'92s a day I\'92d like to take back. I don\'92t know who that is. I know. What about a day you wouldn\'92t even remember? Like a day when you were a baby. - An innocent, mindless little baby. - Take any of those days you want. - Take them all for all I care. - Oh, just one will do. OK, good. A day from your childhood it is. I guess there\'92s nothing wrong with wanting a little time for myself. Just 24 tiny little hours. - I\'92m still my own ogre! - Yeah, you is! I never needed to ask for anyone\'92s permission before. So why start now? Go on, Shrek. Sign it! Go on, Shrek. Sign it, Shrek! Sign it! You signed it.\

\f1\b0 : So, tell me. What happens now? Have a nice day. I think I fell on my keys. There are 40 children in that shoe, which is why the weasel goes pop to this very day. Oh, great. As we head over the river and through the woods\'85 Ogre! Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre! This is the part where you run away! Sure is great to be wanted again. Nice one. Fiona? Oh, no. My home. Fiona! Fiona! Are you in there?! All right, Rumpel! This wasn\'92t part of the deal! Rumpel! Ogre! We\'92ve got another one, ladies! Get him! Who are you?! What are you doing in my swamp? Looks like a troublemaker! Spread \'91em! Nice job, ladies! You witches are making a big mistake! I know my rights! You have the right to shut your mouth! Donkey, stop with the singing, will you? Donkey! Donkey, where am I? What\'92s happening? Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song. I\'92m driving, so I\'92m in charge of the music. Will you witches make up your mind?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl320\sa280\partightenfactor0
\cf3 Shrek: Donkey? What\'92s going on? Do you know where Fiona is?\
Donkey: Quiet, ogre! You\'92re gonna get me in trouble and I need this job. I am not going back to work for Old MacDonald. Tell me to E-I-E-I-O. "E-I-E-I-No!" That\'92s what I said.\
Shrek: Where are my babies? And where\'92s your wife, Dragon?\
Donkey: Look, I think you have me confused with some other talking donkey. I\'92ve never seen you before in my life. Never seen me before? Come on, Donkey! And how do you know my name anyway? It\'92s me, Shrek. Your best friend?\
Donkey: A donkey and an ogre friends? That\'92s the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!\
Shrek: Can you at least tell me where they\'92re taking me?\
Donkey: To the same place they take every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.\
Shrek: Stiltskin! - I said quiet! Oh, no. It\'92s time to crumble! Place your bets! Place your bets! We start tout de suite! Yeah! Gingy? Gingy snap! There\'92s one! Disgusting, filthy ogre! Hideous monster! Filthy, filthy creature! Disgusting creature! Move it!\
Shrek: Don\'92t worry, Donkey. I\'92ll get us our lives back.\
Donkey: Yeah, right. Put a little mustard on mine, Captain Crazy! Mr. Stiltskin? You got another customer. - Wolfie! - Yes, Mr. Stiltskin. Bring me my business wig. Mr. Stiltskin, please! - OK, go. - Please make me a real boy! Go away! Terms are in the details, balsa boy. Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne! Stiltskin! Shrek! There he is! So close! Have I been waiting for you! Ladies, this is the guy that made all of this possible! So, tell me, how are you enjoying your day? All right, Rumpel, what\'92s going on? What have you done? No, Shrek, it\'92s not what I\'92ve done. It\'92s what you\'92ve done. Thanks to you, the King and Queen signed their kingdom over to me. They would never do that. They would if I promised them all their problems would disappear. And then they disappeared! They would have done anything if they thought it would end their daughter\'92s curse. I ended Fiona\'92s curse! How could you when you never existed? You better start making sense, you dirty little man! Here, let me spell it out for you! You gave me a day from your past, a day you couldn\'92t even remember. A day when you were an innocent, mindless little baby. You took the day I was born. No, Shrek. You gave it to me. Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin, because when this day is up\'85 But you haven\'92t heard the best part. Since you were never born, once this day comes to an end, so will you.\
Shrek: Where\'92s Fiona? Where\'92s my family? Silly little ogre. You don\'92t get it, do you? You see, you were never born. You never met Fiona. Your kids don\'92t exist. How\'92s that for a metaphysical paradox? Looks like you got exactly what you wanted! - Happy Ogre Day!\

Shrek: Fine! Go ahead! Run away! Who needs you? I\'92ve never seen an ogre cry. I\'92m not crying. It\'92s nothing to be ashamed of. I cry all the time. Just thinking about my grandma, or thinking about baby kittens, or my grandma kissing a baby kitten, or a little baby grandma kitten. - That is so darn sad. - I said, I\'92m not crying! Take it easy, I\'92m only trying to help. It\'92s none of my business why you\'92re upset. By the way, why are you upset? I was tricked into signing something I shouldn\'92t have. You signed up for one of them time-shares, huh? No. I signed this. You should never sign a contract with Rumpelstiltskin! Yeah, I got that. - His fine print is crafty. - I know. - His exit clauses are sneaky. - Yeah, I\'85 - What did you say? - I\'92m talking about the exit clause. Used to be, you had to guess his name, but now everybody knows who Rumpelstiltskin is. Donkey, I\'92ve read the fine print. There\'92s nothing about an exit clause in here. Well, you didn\'92t expect him to make it easy for you. Here, let me show you how it\'92s done. I didn\'92t spend all that time around them witches without picking up a few tricks. Your tiny, little ogre brain couldn\'92t begin to comprehend the complexity of my polygonic foldability skills. What are you doing? Hey, I can\'92t get my origami on unless you back off. Thank you. OK, here\'92s what you gotta do. You fold this piece here, make this letter match up here, bring this corner here, and if you do it just right, it will show you what to do. There! "Try Lou\'92s Bliss. " Who\'92s Lou? Give me that! "True Love\'92s Kiss. " You have to take me to dinner first. "According to fairy tale law, if not fully satisfied, true love\'92s kiss will render this contract null and void. " Donkey, you did it! Look at you! If Fiona and I share true love\'92s kiss, I will get my life back! OK! This isn\'92t a petting zoo! So where is this Fiona? Well, that\'92s just it, you see. I don\'92t know. You know, when I lose something, I always try to retrace my steps. So\'85 where did you leave her last? The last time I saw her, I told her I wished I\'92d never rescued her. - Oh, no. - Shrek? Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek! What, are you crazy? That\'92s the Dragon\'92s Keep! They keep dragons in there! OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead! I\'92m gonna just hang back here and find us some breakfast! Fiona! Oh, no. If I didn\'92t save Fiona\'85 \'85then who did? This is the favour Fiona was supposed to give me on the day we met. It\'92s a symbol of our love. Now smell it! Hey, man, get that dirty favour out of my face! Your nose is the only chance I have of tracking down my wife, so stop complaining and start smelling. Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl! Do I look like a bloodhound to you? In case you haven\'92t noticed, I\'92m a donkey, not a dog! If I was a dog, they\'92d call me Dog, not Donkey! And another thing\'85 Wait a minute. I think I got something. - Whatever it is, it\'92s sweet. - Fiona. Luscious and tasty. Hey! That\'92s my wife you\'92re talking about. Donkey!\

Bad Donkey! Mustn\'92t. I said, don\'92t! Don\'92t! No! Get away from it. You did. Look out! Donkey! - Are you OK? - I\'92m fine. Donkey. Help! Help me! Help, Shrek! Help! Watch your head. Hey, it\'92s a new guy! Look at him, all dressed up in his Sunday vest. He\'92s really tiny, isn\'92t he? Yeah. Fate has delivered us a comrade-in-arms and for that, we are thankful. Suit him up! - Let\'92s go, greenie. - Now, wait a minute! - Hey! - Here you go. - Welcome to the resistance. - Resistance? We fight for freedom and ogres everywhere! I didn\'92t know we could do that. Help! You can\'92t eat me! I got the mange! - I\'92m poisonous! I\'92m all poi\'85 - I\'92ll take him! This order\'92s to go. Hey! I haven\'92t removed his giblets yet. Trust me, you don\'92t want to eat this one. I go down smooth, but come out fighting! - Let go! - Don\'92t make Mama mad. Your dinner is my friend! - Come on, guys! - I got to get the giblets out! - She\'92s back. - There she is. Fiona! I\'92m so happy I found you! Maybe you missed orientation, but for future reference, personal space is very important to me. You don\'92t know who I am, do you? No. Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away. Gather the others and meet me in the war room. Gretched, make sure everyone is prepared to move out tonight. - I need to talk to you. - What is it? OK, I know you don\'92t remember me, but\'85 \'85we\'92re married. Hear me out. And at the birthday party with some pigs and a puppet, the villagers wanted me to sign their pitchforks, and this boy kept saying, "Do the roar. " Then I punched the cakes that the pigs ate and the next thing I knew, my donkey fell in your waffle hole. Right? Who\'92s with me? I guess I must have kicked him harder than I thought. Fiona, I need to\'85 Witches! All right, everyone, you know the drill! - Fiona! - Witches! Oh, no! - Witches! Witches! - Come on, now. Fiona, that\'92s the third patrol today. We can\'92t hide forever. Trust me, Brogan. After tonight, we won\'92t have to. - That\'92s your wife? - That\'92s my wife. Well, I see who wears the chain mail in your family! Some people like to look at the goblet as\'85 as half empty. Me, I like to look at it as half full. We\'92ve gone from the bottom to the top, ladies. But we\'92re not just an empire. We\'92re a family. Everyone has got their cupcake? Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba? Good. Yeah, you know, we have put away a lot of ogres. And so one got away. Who cares? It\'92s not a big deal. It doesn\'92t matter to me. It\'92s not like it\'92s the end of the world. Except\'85 funny thing. Now that I think about it, the ogre who got away is Shrek! And if he shares a kiss with Fiona by sunrise, it is the end of the world! Our world! My empire! But, as I was saying, I like to look at the goblet as half full. Yelling makes me so parched. Would anyone care for some water? Wet your whistle? A clear, crisp, delicious glass\'85 \'85of agua purificada? Anybody\'92s thirsty? Nobody\'92s thirsty? No? Well, then does anyone care to tell me what it\'92s going to take to get this ogre? You. Faster brooms? - No! - Pointier hats? - No! You! - Maybe we could hire a professional bounty hunter? What a world! What a world! You know, actually not a bad idea. Baba! I need a bounty hunter. And if music doth soothe the savage beast\'85 \'85then I think I might know just the person! Listen up, everyone. Word has come from Far Far Away. Stiltskin is leading tonight\'92s ogre hunt himself. - He\'92s never done that before. - What? Why? I bet that\'92s because of us. If that cupcake-eating clown finally leaves the safety of his filthy witch nest\'85 \'85he\'92ll be vulnerable. The plan\'92s simple. If they follow the usual patrol route, they\'92ll reach the river by midnight. We\'92ll be concealed along this road, waiting for his caravan. Once they reach the clearing, I\'92ll give the signal. And then we attack! And when the smoke clears\'85 Wait, what\'92s this? That\'92s my chimichanga stand. No, Cookie. We won\'92t be needing that. Trust me, Fiona. Y\'92all gonna be really hungry after this ambush, OK? Go and finish your little speech. All right, as I was saying, when the smoke clears, Rumpelstiltskin is gone and the chimichangas have been eaten. Far Far Away will finally be free. - And so will we. - Spread the word. We move out as soon as Rumpel leaves the palace. - Man, this is serious! - Tell me about it. How am I ever gonna get her to kiss me before sunrise? Actually, I was talking about the revolution. Revolution? Why don\'92t you just tell her what you told me? About how you\'92re her true love and you came from an alternate universe. Well, while I\'92m at it, why don\'92t I tell her that you\'92re married to a fire-breathing dragon and you have little, mutant donkey-dragon babies. I do?! You saw what happened. She\'92s gonna think I\'92m crazy. I\'92m a daddy? You know what? If I got Fiona to kiss me once\'85 \'85then I can do it again. Shrek, do my babies have hooves or talons? Donkey\'85! Hello? Fiona? You should not be here, seor. Puss? You\'92ve gotta be kidding me. Feed me, if you dare. Puss, what happened to you? You got so fa\'85 \'85fancy. - Do I know you? Well, where\'92s your hat? Where\'92s your belt? Your wee little boots? Boots? For a cat? Ha! But you\'92re Puss in Boots. Maybe once. But that is a name I have outgrown. That\'92s not the only thing you\'92ve outgrown. Hey! I may have let myself go a little since retirement, but hanging up my sword was the best decision of my life. I have all the cream I can drink and all the mice I can chase. I\'92ll get him later. Puss, what have I done to you? You\'92ve gone soft. Well, I do get brushed twice a day. Look, it\'92s not too late to fix it. All you have to do is help me get a kiss from Fiona. What are you doing? Can I help you with something? Well, I know how stressful mounting a rebellion can be\'85 \'85rallying the troops, planning attacks, so I brought you a little something to ease the tension. A gift basket? You\'92re welcome. So let\'92s see what you got. Heart-shaped box of slugs. Skunk-scented candle. - Look, this really isn\'92t the\'85 -\

Oh, yeah. I always like to quad my lutes and do some scrunches before an operational\'85 op. This one taken? We use that to clean the toilets. And we use that one to clean the thing we clean the toilets with. I knew that. There you go, chief. Hey\'85 Scott? My name is Shrek, actually.

I am not believing what I have just witnessed. Back there, you and Fiona. There was a spark\'85 a spark inside her heart I thought was long extinguished. It was as if, for one moment, Fiona had actually found her true love! I am her true love. I ended her curse. You know of her curse? By day, one way, by night another. This shall be the norm. Until you find true love\'92s first kiss\'85 and then take love\'92s true form. You even know the little rhyme! It is true! You are the one! You must prove it to her! - How? - Convince her! Go to her when she is alone and tell her something that only her true love would know. Know about what?! Whoa! That\'92s a whole lot of kitty! Shrek, can we keep him? Excuse me. Coming through! Pardon me, guys! Watch your back. Look, Donkey, the chimichanga cart! Quick! ndale! After him, burro! Donkey, vmonos! Man, you are a cat-astrophe! And you are ri-donkey-lous! I\'92ll scout ahead. Wait for my signal. Secure your positions! - It\'92s quite a view from up here. - What are you doing?! Get back in position! You need to know, once and for all, who I really am. You are going to ruin everything! Ruin everything? Actually, I\'92m gonna fix everything\'85 The ogres, Rumpel, your curse. How do you know about my curse?! OK, OK, please, Fiona\'85 Just hear me out. I can explain everything. - Where\'92s Fiona\'92s signal? - What\'92s she waiting for? - He\'92s going to get away! - No, he\'92s not. Listen, I don\'92t know who you are or how you know about my curse, but if any of these ogres find out I\'92m\'85 - A beautiful princess? - That is not who I am! Not anymore. - Look, I know you\'92re upset. - You don\'92t know anything about me. I know everything about you. I know you sing so beautifully that birds explode. - Big deal. - I know that when you sign your name, - you put a heart over the "I". - So what? I know that when you see a shooting star, you cross your fingers on both hands, squinch up your nose and you make a wish. I know that you don\'92t like the covers wrapped around your feet, and I know that you sleep by candlelight because every time you close your eyes\'85 \'85you\'92re afraid you\'92re gonna wake up back in that tower. But, most importantly, Fiona\'85 \'85I know that the reason you turn human every day\'85 \'85is because you\'92ve never been kissed\'85 \'85well\'85 \'85by me. - You move fast. - It\'92s not me doing the moving. - Why is this happening?! - Love? - No, I\'92m being forced to dance! - By love! No, I can\'92t stop myself! Please! Make it stop! I can\'92t control myself! Yeah! Cookie\'92s bringing the heat out of the kitchen! Oh, no! It\'92s the Piper! I can\'92t believe I let this happen, and it\'92s all because of you! - If you\'92d just let me kiss you! - What? You\'92re insane! We must do something before they fandango themselves into oblivion! - What can we do? - First, you must stop dancing! When somebody tooties that fluty, I got to shake my booty! Then it\'92s up to me! Hurry! We must get them away from the music! Puss and Donkey to the rescue! We saved the day! Donkey\'85 Can I borrow your tongue? Say what?! No. Hell\'85 I don\'92t care how big your eyes get, player, it\'92s not going down. All right! Stop! - Where are you going? - To save my friends. - How, by getting yourself killed? - If that\'92s what it takes. Puss, say something. - Puss? - Let me explain. That\'92s how you knew so much about me. - Fiona, wait! Kiss me. - What? It\'92s the only way to save your friends. Get out of my way. You used to believe that a single kiss could solve everything! I don\'92t understand. This doesn\'92t make any sense. True love\'92s kiss was supposed to fix everything! Yeah, you know, that\'92s what they told me, too. True love didn\'92t get me out of that tower. I did. I saved myself. Don\'92t you get it? It\'92s all just a big fairy tale. Fiona, don\'92t say that. It does exist! How would you know? Did you grow up locked away in a dragon\'92s keep? Did you live all alone in a miserable tower? Did you cry yourself to sleep every night, waiting for a true love that never came?! But\'85 But I\'92m your true love. Then where were you when I needed you? Maybe you kissed her wrong? No. The kiss didn\'92t work\'85 \'85because Fiona doesn\'92t love me. Don\'92t despair, fellow ogres! They can put us in cages, but they can\'92t cage our honour! Shrek and Fiona are together?! Yeah, I\'92ve heard enough of your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it! Wolfie! My speech wig. Baba! Ready my makeup. And Piper, pull my socks up. - Tight. - Attention, citizens. Please stay tuned for a message from our tyrannical dictator! Hello, people. It is I, Rumpelstiltskin\'85 \'85shepherd of your dreams. Recently, a certain somebody has jeopardized our joyous lives. And that somebody is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek! That is why I come to you, dear citizens. For whomever brings me this ogre, shall receive the deal of a lifetime. Just think of it! Total and - complete happiness. - Ya! Dazzling, radiant fulfilment! All your greatest wishes. - Yeah! - Your wildest dreams. Anything you could ever want! No strings attached! But hurry, this is a limited time offer. So light your torches, sharpen your pitchforks and get your mob on! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Go back where you came from! It seems that we are safe. Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky and torchy out there. Let\'92s go. What\'92s the point? The kiss didn\'92t work. It\'92s over. Look, Shrek, I know things might seem a little bleak right now, but things always work themselves out in the end, you\'92ll see. - I bet by this time tomorrow\'85 - Don\'92t you understand? There is no tomorrow. There\'92s no day after that, and there\'92s no day after that day after that! My life was perfect and I\'92m never going to get it back! If your life was so perfect, why\'92d you sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin? Because I didn\'92t know what I had until it was gone! All right? I didn\'92t know what I had. Surrender now! I\'92m taking you in! Don\'92t try to fight it, ogre! The reward is mine! Gingy? - You unhand me, green devil! - What are you doing? Collecting my bounty! - Bounty? - What are you talking about, cracker? Rumpelstiltskin promised the deal of a lifetime - for whoever could bring you in. - Deal of a lifetime? Where all your wishes come true. Wait a minute. - I can still fix this. - How you gonna do that? You know what? I\'92m gonna give Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants. OK, Gingy, tell me about this\'85 Were you going to eat that? Not Shrek. That is not Shrek. Also not Shrek. That\'92s not even an ogre, it is a troll! Nice try. - And that\'85 - Roar. \'85is just sad. And what is that supposed to be? I\'92m just a frightened old man. Don\'92t listen to him! These ogres are crafty! That is your father painted green.\

All right! Finally! Who turned him in? Who gets the deal of a lifetime? - I do. - What? But\'85 If I\'92m turning myself in, I get the deal of a lifetime. That means you have to give me anything I want. No! Only true love\'92s kiss can break your contract! So if you thought you were just gonna\'85 \'85in here and get your life back\'85 - I\'92m not here to get my life back. Then what do you want? The ogres. They are all free. But where is Shrek? This is not good. I don\'92t know. Not much of a storybook ending. The noble Shrek turns himself in to save a bunch of filthy ogres. All that matters is that they\'92re free\'85 \'85and Fiona is safe. I bet Fiona would be really touched to hear that. But, hey\'85 \'85I guess you can tell her yourself. Fiona! Stiltskin, we had a deal! You agreed to free all ogres! Oh, yeah. But Fiona isn\'92t all ogre, is she? By day, one way, by night, another. Blardy, blardy, blar. Nobody\'92s smart but me! That was a really brave thing you did, Shrek. Thank you. No, you were right. I wasn\'92t there for you. And not just at the Dragon\'92s Keep, but\'85 \'85every day since. Well\'85 \'85you\'92re here now. Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek! Don\'92t be a fool, mule! She\'92s right. Rumpel\'92s palace is locked up tighter - than Old Mother Hubbard\'92s Cupboard. - And that cupboard wasn\'92t guarded by a whole bunch of mean, ugly, nasty witches. Hey! We can hear you! Sorry! We must get into the palace. Man, Shrek and me just busted out of that place! But how? The same way we\'92re gonna bust in. Yay! My new pretty ball! Didn\'92t it look bigger in the catalogue? I guess it\'92ll have to do. Witches, finally, the moment we\'92ve all been waiting for. The main event of the evening! I present Shrek and Fiona! And now, to put the past behind us once and for all, I give you a princess\'92s worst nightmare! Fiona\'92s old flame, the keeper of the keep\'85 \'85Dragon! - Donkey?\

         Shrek and Fiona officiate at a boat christening for the Royal\
         Navy.\
                        \
         Shrek is holding a bottle of champagne. He leans on the\
         boat, accidentally pushing it down the ramp. Shrek throws\
         the bottle at the boat and it punches an enormous hole in the\
         side of the hull. The boat quickly sinks.\
                        \
         Shrek turns to find the patrons of Far Far Away shaking their\
         heads as they leave.\

                        \
         Raul, the make-up specialist, tightens some aprons around\
         Shrek and Fiona. Donkey, Puss and Raul stand in front of\
         them.\
                        \
                         DONKEY\
          Well, since you\'92re filling in for\
          one, you might as well look like a\
          real King. Can somebody come in\
          here and work on Shrek please?\
                        \
         Raul stares at Shrek. Shrek raises his eyebrow.\

         He unrolls a satchel full of different gardening tools.\
                        \
         Suddenly Shrek\'92s arms and legs are strapped into a chair.\
                        \
         A man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip\
         cord as if he\'92s holding a chain saw. VROOM! VROOM! He\
         turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind\
         away at Shrek\'92s gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes.\
                        \
         We see a close-up of Shrek\'92s eye. A mascara brush comes into\
         frame and pulls at Shrek\'92s eyelash.\
                        \
         Fiona gets her nose hairs plucked.\

         Lipstick is applied to some lips. The camera pulls back to\
         reveal that the lips are Shrek\'92s.\
                        \
         A hand tries to tighten a zipper on Shrek\'92s back. It keeps\
         snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and\
         tighten up the zipper all the way.\
                        \
         A small sock is placed onto Shrek\'92s foot. With a shoe horn,\
         Shrek\'92s foot is shoved into a small shoe. POP!\

         A collar is placed around Fiona\'92s neck and her corset is\
         tightened.\
                        \
         A drill comes into frame and tightens the rivet on Shrek\'92s\

         Fiona puckers up her lips and Shrek leans in for a kiss, but\

         Suddenly Shrek\'92s belt buckle snaps off and hits Donkey in the\

         As he is stumbling, he grabs hold of a lady in the crowd.\

                         WOMAN\
          What are you doing?\
                        \
         The woman pushes Donkey away. He falls, knocking over a\
         guard holding an axe on his way down. The guard drops the\
         axe. It flies past Puss, who is in the arms of a lady. The\
         axe knocks over a vase. The vase flies up on stage and Fiona\
         maneuvers to catch it. In flight, water spills out of the\
         vase which causes Fiona to fall over.\
                        \
         Shrek\'92s tuxedo bib slaps him in the face. The clasp holding\
         Shrek\'92s pants up breaks off. Shrek stands on stage with his\
         pants around his ankles. He shuffles towards Fiona.\

                        \
         He trips over his pants and hits a loose wooden plank on the\
         stage. The plank flings up and sends Fiddlesworth flying\
         through the air where his jacket slips over a banner pole,\
         trapping him.\

         Fiona\'92s eyes suddenly widen.\

         Fiddlesworth\'92s jacket rips and he falls onto a waiter\

          Ahhhh!\
                        \
         The skewers fly through the air. Donkey stands up in frame\
         with one eye half shut. The flaming skewers shoot by him and\
         land in the curtains, setting them on fire. He blows one of\
         the skewers out and takes a bite.\

         Shrek picks Puss up by the scruff of his neck and tosses him\
         outside the window. He shuts it. Puss sits sadly on the\

         A group is gathered around Cyclops riding a medieval\
         mechanical bull, hooting and hollering. The bull stops and\
         the Villains turn to look at Prince Charming.\
                        \
         Prince Charming hangs his cape on a tree branch. The camera\
         adjusts right to reveal the branch is actually one of the\
         Evil Trees, who flings the cape to the floor. Everyone takes\
         notice as Prince Charming walks through. Little Red Riding\
         Hood is sitting on a pile of books at a table. Evil Dwarves\
         glare in Prince Charming\'92s direction. Prince Charming walks\
         by a pair of witches (one is the Evil Queen from Snow White)\
         playing pool. The Evil Queen scratches when she sees him and\
         the pool ball goes flying into the Headless Horseman\'92s neck.\
         Prince Charming walks by the singing witch. He reaches the\
         bar, pulls out a handkerchief, places it over the bar stool,\
         and sits.\
                        \
         Prince Charming spots the bartender with her back to him. He\
         clears his throat.\
                        \
                         PRINCE CHARMING\
          What does a Prince have to do to\
          get a drink around here?\
                        \
         Mabel, the other ugly stepsister, rises up in front a poster\
         with a smiling beer wench.\
                        \
                         PRINCE CHARMING\
          Ah Mabel, why they call you an ugly\
          stepsister I\'92ll never know.\
                        \
         He winks at her. She glares at him.\
                        \
                         PRINCE CHARMING\
          Where\'92s Doris, taking the night\

          She\'92s not welcome here and neither\
          are you.\
                        \
         She spits into the mug and wipes it with a towel.\
                        \
                         MABEL (CONT\'92D)\

          And a Fuzzy Navel.\
                        \
         Prince Charming stands up and turns to the bar patrons.\
                        \
                         PRINCE CHARMING\

                        \
         Captain Hook rips his hook across the piano keys. The\
         singing witch bares her teeth. The witches break their pool\
         cues. The Puppet Master breaks his beer mug.\
                        \
                         CAPTAIN HOOK\
          We\'92re not your friends.\

         Prince Charming grows nervous.\
                        \
         The Villains all approach Prince Charming.\
                        \
         From behind the bar, Mabel grabs Prince Charming by his\
         shoulders and pins him on top of the bar.\
                        \
                         PRINCE CHARMING\
          Ahh!\

         Captain Hook places his hook against Prince Charming\'92s neck.\

                         PRINCE CHARMING\
          Once upon a time, someone decided\
          that we were the losers. But there\
          are two sides to every story. And\
          our side has not been told.\
                        \
         The crowd listens, rapt.\

                         PRINCE CHARMING\
          So who will join me? Who wants to\
          come out on top for once? Who\
          wants their happily ever after?!\
                        \
         The crowd of villains cheer and starts getting rowdy. A bar\
         room brawl ensues. Prince Charming looks on, shocked. He\
         ducks out of the way of a flying liquor bottle. He smiles\
         nervously and lifts his fruity, Fuzzy Navel to drink.\

         The blind mice stumble and fall trying to get down the steps\

         gathered to wish Shrek, Puss and Donkey a bon voyage as they\

         On the docks, two Dronkeys chase a seagull as the camera pans\
         over to Puss who breaks free of the embrace of a lady cat.\
                        \
                         PUSS\
          It\'92s out of my hands senorita, the\

         Off-screen, a cat meows and walks towards Puss.\

          And you.\
                        \
         Puss starts walking away as two of the cats begin to engage\
         in a cat fight. They are hissing at each other as Puss backs\
         away from them and into another.\

                         PUSS (CONT\'92D)\

          but I\'92d like to. I gotta go.\
                        \
         Puss runs out of frame. Cut to Dragon, who is talking to\
         Donkey. Puss runs past them in the background. Dragon lets\
         out a soft wail.\
                        \
                         DONKEY\
          I know, I know\'85 I don\'92t want to\
          leave you either baby, but you know\
          how Shrek is. The dude\'92s lost\

         She gives him an understanding smile.\

         eventually stops after completely soiling himself and Shrek.\

         and Shrek dives to catch him. Another baby is pulling the\
         tablecloth, causing lethal knives to fly straight at him.\
         Shrek snatches the baby away just before he is impaled. One\
         of the babies strikes a match near the fireplace. Shrek runs\
         over, picks up the baby and blows out the match. He takes a\
         baby out of the cauldron.\

         Shrek motions to Artie, but he\'92s gone. They all look around.\

         The boat suddenly pitches to the right. Shrek braces\

         Artie swings the wheel around, sending the boat back in the\
         direction of his school. Shrek works his way into the cabin\
         and gains control of the wheel. The drunken Ship Captain\
         slides by.\

         Artie falls to the ground and slides to the back of the boat.\
                        \
         A shuffle board stick slides next to Artie. He grabs it.\

         Artie falls underneath the wheel. He stands up shoving the\

          Whoaaa!\
                        \
         Shrek grabs the wheel and swings it around. Artie yanks the\
         wheel. They wrestle for control.\

         As soon as the word leaves his lips, Shrek knows he\'92s gone\
         too far. Stung, Artie lets go of the wheel, leaving Shrek to\
         yank hard on it. He pulls the steering column from the\
         decking.\

         Shrek, holding Puss and Donkey, staggers onto a small beach.\
         He glares at Artie who pulls himself out of the surf. Shrek\
         drops Puss and Donkey.\
                        \
         Puss, tired of being wet, shakes himself vigorously. His fur\
         puffs up into a fro. He drops his head in shame.\

         staring at a donkey.\

         The Three Pigs leap onto the stage, going into a drop and\
         roll move to land in between Shrek and Prince Charming. They\
         strike a fighting pose.\
                        \
         Pinocchio comes flying in on his strings, landing with a\
         flurry of kung-fu hands.\

         The Wolf unzips the wolf costume, steps out and joins the\

         Gingerbread Man pops up in the tower window, grabs Rapunzel\'92s\
         hair and swings down. Before he hits the ground, the end\
         catches and he bounces like a bungee jumper. Her hair falls\
         into a pile next to a very surprised Gingerbread Man.\
                        \
         Rapunzel screams. Her mousy brown hair crammed under a hair\
         net. She runs off crying.\

         Prince Charming looks around, almost surrounded.\

         Suddenly a shadow falls over the crowd and they gasp. Dragon\

         The Queen head-butts through one of the backdrops, with\
         Sleeping Beauty and Doris. Snow White flies in behind them\
         with the help of her woodland creatures ("Crouching Tiger,\

         a mop as her weapon. Together, the Princesses strike fierce\

         Prince Charming strikes an imperious pose and claps his\
         hands. Cyclops suddenly emerges from the trap door, knocking\
         Puss and Donkey down. He approaches them menacingly.\
                        \
         The witches fly in and threaten the princesses with their\

         The Evil Dwarves grab The Three Pigs. Gingerbread Man is\

         Artie lands clumsily on a hanging cloud.\

         Artie leaps awkwardly from cloud to cloud. The audience\

         After one last leap, he swings down on the Cherub\'92s cable,\

         Shrek sets Prince Charming down and signals DRAGON. She\
         casually tips the tower over with her tail. A shadow falls\
         over Prince Charming. He turns and sees the tower falling\
         toward him, his body perfectly framed up in the princesses\'92s\
         window.\

         As the dust clears, the crown rolls across the stage. Artie\
         stops it with his foot and slowly picks it up.\

         Artie turns to the audience and holds out the crown to them.\
         They cheer him.\

         Artie places the crown on his head. The crowd goes nuts. In\

         Everybody cheers as the Fairy-tale Creatures and Villains put\
         Artie up on their shoulders and carry him off. Donkey and\
         Puss, still in each other\'92s bodies, watch as Artie gets\
         carried away.\

         In a puff of smoke, Merlin suddenly appears. He looks around\

         Merlin rolls up his sleeves, and prepares to make with the\
